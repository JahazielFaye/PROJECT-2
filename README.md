An App for users to share and discover new recommendations for places to visit, such as coffee shops, parks, and restaurants. Users can create a profile and make posts about their favorite places, including a title, description, and location. They can also browse and search for recommendations made by other users. The website also includes a feed page where users can view the latest recommendations and a categories page where they can view recommendations by category. Additionally, the website includes a navigation menu that allows users to access their profile, log out, and view the categories page.
