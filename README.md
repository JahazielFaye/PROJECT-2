An App for users to share and discover new recommendations for places to visit, such as coffee shops, parks, and restaurants. Users can create a profile and make posts about their favorite places, including a title, description, and location. They can also browse and search for recommendations made by other users. The website also includes a feed page where users can view the latest recommendations and a categories page where they can view recommendations by category. Additionally, the website includes a navigation menu that allows users to access their profile, log out, and view the categories page. Overall, the website aims to make it easy for people to find new and exciting places to visit and share their own recommendations with others.
